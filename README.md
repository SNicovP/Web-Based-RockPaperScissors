# Web-Based-RPS

This is a quick first to 3 points (Rock) (Paper) (Scissors) game. The Player will be playing against the computer (Radomized choice each round). The goal is to get 3 points first. You can change the (Choices) to whatever you want and add more incase you want to (Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Anyone?). The game keeps a tally of each participants points and when one reaches 3 points the game is over.
